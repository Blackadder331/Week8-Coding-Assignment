    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>We have worked on a variety of projects  and have deep experience in residential work. Our practice draws inspiration from the unique culture  and climate of this region. We look for the special qualities of each particular place, including the history of its architecture and landscape. We carefully consider each  building  site for views, privacy, sun angles, and tree cover. We make sure that we take advantage of opportunities for natural light, passive heating, and ventilation. It is important to understand the neighborhood and landscape so that each house improves its surroundings for the benefit of your family and the community.</p>
